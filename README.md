## 🧮 math.html – Mathematics: Algebra Basics

Explore one of math’s core foundations — algebra.

### 📘 What Is Algebra?
Algebra uses letters to represent numbers and solve problems logically.

**Example:**  
`3x + 5 = 20` → Solve for x

### 🧩 Key Concepts
1. **Variables** – e.g. `x` in `x + 3 = 7`  
2. **Expressions** – e.g. `2x + 5`  
3. **Equations** – e.g. `2x + 3 = 9`  
4. **Like Terms** – Combine: `2x + 5x = 7x`

### 🧠 Solving Example
`x + 7 = 12` → Subtract 7 → `x = 5 ✅`

### 📋 Glossary
- **Term** – A number/variable/product in an expression  
- **Coefficient** – Multiplies a variable (e.g. 5 in 5x)  
- **Constant** – A number by itself  
- **Equation** – Uses `=`  
- **Expression** – No equal sign

### 🧮 Real-Life Uses
- Budgeting  
- Investment  
- Coding  
- Engineering  
- Recipes

### 📸 Visual Example
*A linear equation graph (`<img>`)*

### 🔊 Audio Tip
> “Always simplify expressions first!”

### 🎥 Video Tutorial
- Solving multi-step equations  
- Algebraic thinking basics  
- Real-life applications

### 🧠 Challenge
Try solving: `3x - 5 = 10`

## 🌍 science.html – Science: The Water Cycle

Understand this key environmental process.

### 💧 What is the Water Cycle?
Water moves through the environment by:
- **Evaporation**
- **Condensation**
- **Precipitation**
- **Collection**

### 🔄 Main Stages
1. Sun heats → vapor  
2. Vapor cools → clouds  
3. Rain/snow falls  
4. Water collects and cycles again

### 🔬 Importance
- Drinking water  
- Crop irrigation  
- Climate regulation  
- Life support  
- Prevents droughts/floods

### 🧠 Quick Facts
- Same water as millions of years ago  
- Plants release water via transpiration  
- 97% of water is saltwater

### 📸 Diagram
*A full water cycle illustration (`<img>`)*
  
### 🔊 Audio Summary
> “Explains stages and their impact.” (`<audio>`)

### 🎥 Educational Videos
- Animated cycle explanation  
- Real-world farming/weather use

### 📘 Real Life
- Farmers need rain/irrigation  
- Weather prediction  
- Water conservation

### 💬 Fun Question
> What happens if evaporation doesn’t occur?
